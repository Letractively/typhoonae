The TyphoonAE project aims at providing a full-featured and productive serving
environment to run Google App Engine (Python) applications. It delivers the
parts for building your own scalable App Engine while staying compatible with
Google's API.

Installation
------------

Since the TyphoonAE Python package contains glue code for various service
components, it is recommended to install this software with zc.buildout and the
buildout configuration which can be downloaded here::

  http://typhoonae.googlecode.com/files/typhoonae-buildout-0.2.0.tar.gz

Unpack the archive and follow the steps described in the README.txt file. This
package and the Google App Engine SDK 1.4.0 will also be installed by the
buildout.

For the ones who don't want to build their own TyphoonAE environment, we supply
a preconfigured VMware appliance. See http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/wiki/VMware for a brief documentation.

Visit the project page http://typhoonae.googlecode.com for further information.
